\description{
Proposes a new point by applying 'emulated gradient descent' on an existing point.
}
\details{
Given a point (preferably close to the implausibility boundary) \code{x}, we can calculate
the emulated gradient at this point for each emulator. If the estimate of the expectation
at this point for a given emulator is larger than the target value, then we would like to
move in the direction of greatest decrease for this emulator, and conversely for an estimate
of the expectation that's smaller than the target value. The combination of this information
for every emulator under consideration defines a preferred set of directions of travel from
this point.

We may try to find a shared direction which improves (or at least does not worsen) all
emulator evaluations. If a point is already well inside the implausibility boundary for a given
output (where 'well inside' is defined by the value of \code{accept}), we may allow this
output to worsen in order to improve the others.

Provided a shared direction, v, can be identified, we iteratively move in this direction. Define
the new proposed point x' = x + h*v, where h is a step-size given by \code{hstart}.. Compare
the summary statistic (either expectational difference or implausibility) to that provided by
the original point; if the new point gives improvement, then continue to move in this direction
until no further improvement is possible for this step-size. The step-size is reduced (up to
a minimum of \code{hcutoff}) and the process is repeated. Only finitely many iteration steps
are permitted; this can be tuned by supplying a value of \code{iteration.steps}.
