Changelog (Release Branch)
05/08/2021 - v0.8.9. Fixes to variance emulator construction; effect_strength function addes to investigate active parameter impact; function-call vignette included.

02/08/2021 - v0.8.8. New variance emulator constructor (old version exists but is deprecated); cluster point proposal algorithm for higher-dimensional spaces; minor fixes and improvements.

02/07/2021 - v0.8.7. Added more diagnostic plots, as well as additional options to existing plots (for example, log-scaling and normalisation)

08/06/2021 - v0.8.6. New plotting and visualisation functionality

03/06/2021 - v0.8.5. Diagnostic wrapper added for plotting multiple wave results.

13/05/2021 - v0.8.4. Complete rewrite and refactor; package renamed from emulatorr to hmer

30/03/2021 - v0.7.2. Stability changes across the board, including a modification to IDEMC generation for high-dimensional input spaces (to combat k-means clustering issues).

10/03/2021 - v0.7.1c. Bug fixes, and minor changes (see individual commit messages)

04/03/2021 - v0.7.1b. Bug fixes and stability: changes to generate_new_runs; support for 1d systems, and models whose regression surface is constant. Updated examples and documentation.

01/03/2021 - v0.7.1a. Bug fixes and stability improvements: particularly in IDEMC. Works with larger dimensional parameter spaces, and efficiencies applied.

29/01/2021 - v0.7.1. Additional functionality for derivative emulation. A rudimentary proposal function for generating acceptable fits from points just outside the non-implausible region is included (directional_proposal). Currently experimental, as with all of the derivative emulation functionality.

27/01/2021 - v0.7.0. Including Deriative Emulation. The emulator functions get_exp and get_cov can be given an additional parameter, p, which when supplied returns the expectation and variance of the derivative of the function in the p direction.

19/11/2020 - v6.0.2c. Bug fixes and slight changes to some functionality: diagnostics now don't flag points that are way outside of the target range; if points are generated by LHS they are not re-vetted by importance_sample; modifications to documentation.

06/11/2020 - v6.0.2b. Minor bug fixes: the punifs function takes a vector of radii, to check membership of a uniform ellipsoid; uniqueness of proposed points is checked in importance_sample with digit significance (to remove issues with perfectly correlated points being used to train emulators!); small fixes to point generation. Additional option in wave_points to control whether points are plotted with a black boundary (which can obscure details for large numbers of points/parameters). Slight efficiency improvement in Emulator$adjust.

28/10/2020 - v6.0.2a. A couple of bug fixes: modified exp_sq so that it will accept non-isotropic correlation lengths; fixed a bug in hyperparam_fit that was giving transformed estimates of correlation length and nugget term.

26/10/2020 - v6.0.2. Importance sampling samples on ellipses rather than spheres, to fix the cases where some parameter ranges are vastly smaller/larger than others; bug fix to idemc generation; model building now fits a quadratic surface without interaction terms to determine the active variables.

16/10/2020 - v6.0.1a. Fixes to the working of generate_new_runs for speed; idemc generation now takes into account if a proposed point is outside the parameter ranges; model building determines active variables by fitting a linear surface to the data before proceeding with a full quadratic fit.

13/10/2020 - v6.0.1. Multiple changes to documentation for readability and to reflect new functionality. Changed some default behaviours (for example, plot_lattice) for computational efficiency.

12/10/2020 - v0.6.0. Added Implausibility-Driven Evolutionary Monte Carlo for point generation. Tidied up some documentation (including removing some internal documentation from man pages).

08/10/2020 - <v0.6.0. Changed the way that hyperparameters are estimated - uses the nlme package to estimate correlation lengths. Fits a surface to the residuals from the linear model, and the sigma and theta generated from this form the specifications for the correlation structure.
